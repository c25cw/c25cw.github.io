	<h1>Charlie's Journal</h1>
<p>October 2 </p>

So far, in CS1 we have learned the basics on how to generate a web page and add elements to it as well as style said elements to a way we like them by positioning them and layering them on top of each other. I’m feeling alright about the stuff we’ve learned so far. I’m sure that the more I practice and code, I’d generally learn more and get better at coding. I’m still feeling pretty anxious about the future, as I don’t know anything really about code but I know mostly everybody else is in the same boat so I’m not alone. I also have the privilege of labs to help me learn more. I worked a bit on my website today and was really happy with the progress I made. My goal is for my website to be just what I envisioned it to be.</p>

Today in CS1, I learned how to animate divs using html and CSS. I made a race between two cars on a page. I could always add more cars but for now I’m happy with how it looks. I’ve also made some changes to my website which are looking good although I did run into some trouble trying to position some of my elements. I’ve also begun working on an online birthday card for my mom which is turning out very nicely. I feel like I’m at a point where I’m beginning to understand html and CSS although I still need much more practice. I’m optimistic for my future experiences in CS1, since it’s starting to make more sense to me now.</p>

<p>We’ve learned more and more about javascript and while the basics are beginning to make sense to me, I’m having trouble understanding why things work and also having trouble with more complicated javascript code. I’ve made some progress on my regular websites like my homepage as well as my journal and projects page. I’ve made a few simple javascript codesketches as well as a more complicated one. I feel like css and html are continuing to make more sense to me, however I still make mistakes when using them. Currently I’m feeling OK about CS1, because I feel good with html and css but i feel very insecure when it comes to javascript.</p>
