	<h1>Charlie's Journal</h1>
<p>October 2 </p>
<p>
So far, in CS1 we have learned the basics on how to generate a web page and add elements to it as well as style said elements to a way we like them by positioning them and layering them on top of each other. I’m feeling alright about the stuff we’ve learned so far. I’m sure that the more I practice and code, I’d generally learn more and get better at coding. I’m still feeling pretty anxious about the future, as I don’t know anything really about code but I know mostly everybody else is in the same boat so I’m not alone. I also have the privilege of labs to help me learn more. I worked a bit on my website today and was really happy with the progress I made. My goal is for my website to be just what I envisioned it to be.</p>

Today in CS1, I learned how to animate divs using html and CSS. I made a race between two cars on a page. I could always add more cars but for now I’m happy with how it looks. I’ve also made some changes to my website which are looking good although I did run into some trouble trying to position some of my elements. I’ve also begun working on an online birthday card for my mom which is turning out very nicely. I feel like I’m at a point where I’m beginning to understand html and CSS although I still need much more practice. I’m optimistic for my future experiences in CS1, since it’s starting to make more sense to me now.</p>
<p> November 4</p>
<p>We’ve learned more and more about javascript and while the basics are beginning to make sense to me, I’m having trouble understanding why things work and also having trouble with more complicated javascript code. I’ve made some progress on my regular websites like my homepage as well as my journal and projects page. I’ve made a few simple javascript codesketches as well as a more complicated one. I feel like css and html are continuing to make more sense to me, however I still make mistakes when using them. Currently I’m feeling OK about CS1, because I feel good with html and css but i feel very insecure when it comes to javascript.</p>
<p> November 13</p>
<p>I’m beginning to get a solid grasp on the basic javascript language. It’s still difficult for me and I typically need assistance when coding with it. This week I made a new project using javascript and I understand how it works which is really nice because it means that javascript is becoming more natural. I’ve also made some improvements to my journal, projects, and homepage. At times I still feel very stressed out but I’m beginning to find that I’m having more a-Ha moments than ever before.</p>
<p> November 22</p>
<p>Javascript is still confusing for me but it is very slowly but surely making more sense. I have a project idea for something super cool utilizing javascript but I’m not sure how to make it work and it would be very complicated so it would take a very long time. Other than that I’ve begun to work on my “how it works” project in which I’ll be investigating discord and discord bots. I’m excited to learn more about discord since I use it fairly often and I’m excited to learn more about javascript so I can create unique projects.</p>
<p> January 31</p>
<p> Following the events of winter break and stopping coding for a little while, I have forgotten mostly how to write in javascript. I have made a few new codesketches and have started working on a more complicated one. I'm pretty happy how my work is turning out so far but I still wish to get better</p>
<p> March 3</p>
<p> I've made some very good progress in many regards in the second semester and I've also made a lot of new codesketches that I am proud of. I still have a lot of questions though, here are ten: 
	1. What is an if/else statement?
	2. Why would an if/else statement be helpful?
	3. Where can I find new libraries to look through to inspire me?
	4. What is the difference between an array and a forloop
	5. How exactly does positioning and sizing work?
	6. Is there a difference when you make a div in html and css vs. javascript?
	7. How do I make an image bigger than the actual image size?
	8. Is it difficult to make games or are they complicated
	9. What does a code for a real video game look like and how much of it could I understand?
	10. Are there more complex ways to style divs or only the simplistic css comands?<p>
