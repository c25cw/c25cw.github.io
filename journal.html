	<h1>Charlie's Journal</h1>
<p>October 2 
So far, in CS1 we have learned the basics on how to generate a web page and add elements to it as well as style said elements to a way we like them by positioning them and layering them on top of each other. I’m feeling alright about the stuff we’ve learned so far. I’m sure that the more I practice and code, I’d generally learn more and get better at coding. I’m still feeling pretty anxious about the future, as I don’t know anything really about code but I know mostly everybody else is in the same boat so I’m not alone. I also have the privilege of labs to help me learn more. I worked a bit on my website today and was really happy with the progress I made. My goal is for my website to be just what I envisioned it to be.</p></div>
